# GoGrow - Workshop React

*Last Updated: August 29th, 2022*

The intent of this workshop is to learn the basics of React, covering the fundamentals concepts of the library like Components, LifeCycle, JSX, Props, State, Side effects, API requests, and more. After completing it, you should be able to work on small projects independently.



## Description

Our objective is to create a Pokemon App, using [Poke API](https://pokeapi.co/) which will allow us to get a Pokemon list and its description by making API requests using [Axios](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro).
We will be able to navigate from the Pokemon list (our Home page) to the Pokemon detail by clicking on a Pokemon using [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/en/main).
Finally, we will host our Poke App on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)

#### Sound good, doesn't it?. Take a look at the App design on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/lLX0V1Ez4Xa4I3IS273477/Poke-App?node-id=0%3A1)
